//! LTC-style physical layer: biphase-mark code (BMC).
//!
//! Status: **provisional** AML v1 profiles (spec §6.5; design history in
//! `docs/proposals/ltc-bmc.md`). Selected with
//! [`PhyConfig::ltc`](super::PhyConfig::ltc) and related constructors.
//!
//! # Line code
//!
//! Biphase mark, as SMPTE LTC and AES3 use: every bit cell starts with a
//! transition; a `1` has a second transition in the middle of the cell, a `0`
//! has none. Information is carried by *where the transitions are*, never by
//! the level, so the code is polarity-insensitive, DC-free and self-clocking.
//! Between two transitions the receiver sees one of two intervals: a half
//! cell (`H`, half of a `1`) or a full cell (`F`, a `0`).
//!
//! # Frame (one repetition)
//!
//! ```text
//! | preamble: P x '1' | sync: V V | body: 4 x N bits | postamble: '1' | tail |
//! ```
//!
//! * **Preamble** — `preamble_bits` ones: a square wave at the bit rate. The
//!   receiver measures the half-cell length on it (clock acquisition) and
//!   lets its envelope follower settle.
//! * **Sync** — two *code violations* `V`: intervals of 1.5 cells (3 half
//!   cells), first one level, then the other. Valid BMC data only ever
//!   produces `H` and `F` intervals, so `V V` cannot occur inside a body
//!   whatever the payload: the sync is unambiguous without a reserved data
//!   pattern or bit stuffing (AES3 uses violations for the same reason). Being
//!   a pair of opposite-level intervals it is DC-balanced and, like the rest
//!   of the code, polarity-free. The edge ending the second `V` is the start
//!   of the first body bit.
//! * **Body** — the link-layer nibbles, MSB first (exactly what the MFSK phy
//!   would send as tones), 4 bits per nibble.
//! * **Postamble** — one `1` bit: terminates the last body bit with a
//!   transition (its length could not be measured otherwise).
//! * **Tail** — one half cell at the last level, then a shaped fade to 0.
//!
//! The burst is followed by `gap_bits` of silence before the next repetition
//! or message.
//!
//! # Shaping
//!
//! Transitions are raised-cosine steps `edge_frac` half cells wide, placed at
//! exact (fractional) sample positions, so the signal is band-limited (LTC
//! specifies a 25 us +-5 rise time for the same reason) and any sample rate
//! works. Level: `amplitude / sqrt(2)`, i.e. the same RMS as an MFSK tone of
//! the same `amplitude` (fair SNR comparisons, lower peak).
//!
//! # Receiver
//!
//! DC blocker -> 2nd-order low-pass, then two paths on the filtered signal:
//!
//! * **Sync:** a correlator of half-cell box sums against the end of the
//!   preamble plus the two violations; the best peak above a threshold
//!   (snapped to the transition that ends the second violation when one is
//!   close) starts a body. It keeps running during a body, and a clearly
//!   stronger sync replaces a weaker lock, so a false lock never hides a
//!   real packet (the BMC equivalent of the MFSK "rewind on failed decode").
//! * **Body:** soft decisions on a half-cell time grid: each bit compares
//!   the integrals of its two half cells (`1` = opposite signs). The
//!   normalized decision margin is the bit's reliability; a nibble carries
//!   its weakest bit's margin (as `confidence_db`) for the FEC decoder, and
//!   a nibble with a dropout (no signal) is flagged erased. The grid is a
//!   second-order timing loop pulled by the transitions (peak envelope ->
//!   Schmitt trigger with an envelope-relative threshold -> interpolated
//!   zero-crossing times), so a spurious or missing transition only costs
//!   the bits it touches. With FEC a body is abandoned once it has more
//!   erased nibbles than the code can fill.
//!
//! Per-sample cost: the filters, envelope and Schmitt trigger as before,
//! one box-sum update (`half cell` adds), and the correlator (22 multiply-
//! adds plus 22 squares); per bit, two half-cell integrals.
